\chapter{Dynamic HPFC for snake robots}\label{ch:hpfc}

\section{Hybrid position/force controllers}

The goal of the snake robot is to push against obstacles in a fashion that yields forward propulsion along a path. Consequently, the robot will have to curve itself along the path whilst applying a force to the obstacles considered advantageous. The behavior of the robot has to comprise with the constraints arising from the contact, which further motivates the use of hybrid position/force control (HPFC).

HPFC is not a control method per se, but rather a method for determining when and in which directions force or motion control should be applied. It is desired to control motion along the unconstrained motion directions and force along the constrained motion directions. Different approaches to this problem exist. One is the use of selection matrices, introduced by Raibert and Craig et al. \cite{raibert1981hybrid}. The disadvantage of this approach is that the directions in which force and motion should be controlled has to be recalculated for every step, and is no simple procedure. In another approach, introduced by West and Asada \cite{west1985method}, two projection matrices are used as filters in joint space to automatically select between position- and force controlled vectors. There is however a disadvantage to this method as well, which is that the dynamics of the robot are ignored. A thoroughly studied method called dynamic HPFC, developed by Yoshikawa \cite{yoshikawa1987dynamic}, is therefore presented and adapted to the snake robot.

The theory on traditional HPFC up until the part \textit{Passive joints}, as well as this intro, is a modified part of the earlier project work of the author \cite{AtussaProsjektoppgp}. The rest of the chapter is focused on dynamic HPFC and the advantages and challenges that comes with adapting it to a snake robot model. Some modifications attempting to make the control more robust are also presented here.

\subsection{Dynamic HPFC} \label{subsec:DHPFC}

The solution of West and Asada \cite{west1985method} does not take the manipulator dynamics into account. Nevertheless, in a real system, the dynamics play a significant role in the resulting behavior of the robot. For this reason, Yoshikawa \cite{yoshikawa1987dynamic} designed the dynamic hybrid control method which incorporates the constraints into the manipulator dynamics. More specifically, the solution of \cite{west1985method} filters the commanded joint torques and velocities to conform to the constraints and the essential variable space. This is explained in more detail in \ref{subseq:HPFC}. The essence of the solution of \cite{yoshikawa1987dynamic} however, is that the robot dynamics and constraint equations are combined before the commanded torques and angles are calculated. 

This section aims at describing the improved method, and the content is based the paper of \cite{yoshikawa1987dynamic}. The symbolic conventions used are for simplicity the same as in the paper. The next section will explain further how the theory and these symbols apply to the snake robot case and the snake robot specific theory presented earlier in this chapter (\ref{sec:kin}-\ref{seq:constraints}).

It is worth noting that the solution of Yoshikawa is designed for a robot manipulator with a static base where the only constraint present is targeted at the manipulator end effector. For this reason, special effort has been put into finding a suitable formulation of the snake robot constraints. Additionally, the difference between the coordinate spaces introduced in the paper are easy to confuse and special attention has been directed at thoroughly defining these spaces for the snake robot so that the following calculations can be both as clear and logical as possible.

\subsubsection{Description of variables}

A brief overview of the most significant new variables used in this section is provided below.
The most general variables correspond to the ones presented in \ref{sec:kin}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathbf{r_t}$: task coordinates related to the contact point (task) coordinate system
    \item $\mathbf{r_c}$: constraint coordinates related to the fixed obstacle coordinate system
    \item $\mathbf{E}_F$: axes of constraints on the force in the task frame
    \item $\mathbf{E}_P$: axes of constraints on the position in the task frame
    \item $\mathbf{J}_t$: Jacobian relating the joint coordinates $\dot{\mathbf{q}}$ to the task coordinates $\dot{\mathbf{r}}_t$
    \item $\boldsymbol{\tau}_c$: control torque
    \item $\boldsymbol{\tau}_F$: torque from the desired force
    \item $\boldsymbol{\tau}_P$: torque from the desired position
\end{itemize}

The task and obstacle (constraint) frames $\mathbf{r_t}$ and $\mathbf{r_c}$ are visualized in Figure \ref{fig:rt-rc}. The values for both $r_{t,i} = [x_{t,i}, y_{t,i}, \theta_{t,i}]$ and $r_{c,i} = [x_{c,i}, y_{c,i}, \theta_{c,i}]$ are defined with respect to the base frame. It should be noted that the task frame, as opposed to the constraint frame, is allowed to rotate with respect to the base frame.

    \label{fig:rt-rc}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Description of constraints}

In order to take the dynamics into account, the constraints are directly included into the dynamic equations of motion of the robot. This is done by expressing the constraints as a set of hypersurfaces that the robot can not physically pass. It should be noted that the focus here is on manipulator end-effector constraints and not general constraints which should be used in the snake robot case. The constraint hypersurfaces are also expressed in the end-effector coordinates. Another important aspect of the paper is that it only addresses bilateral hypersurfaces (and not unilateral surfaces), meaning that the effector is prohibited from leaving the surface in any direction.

The $m$ hypersurfaces expressing a given constraint are given by

\begin{equation}\label{eq:hpfc:hypersurface}
    p_i(\mathbf{r}_t) = 0, \quad i = 1, 2, ..., m,
\end{equation}
\\
where $\mathbf{r}_t$ is the end effector position in a fixed reference frame. Differentiating (\ref{eq:hpfc:hypersurface}) with respect to time yields

\begin{equation}\label{eq:hpfc:derhypsurf}
    \mathbf{E}_F \mathbf{\dot{r}}_t = 0,
\end{equation}
\\
where the vectors of $\mathbf{E}_F$ are the unit normal vectors to the hypersurfaces in (\ref{eq:hpfc:hypersurface}).

By comparing the expression (\ref{eq:norm_vel5}) of the constraint on link $i$ found in \ref{seq:constraints} to (\ref{eq:hpfc:derhypsurf}), it is possible to extract the matrix $\mathbf{E}_{F,i}$ and a logical choice of $\mathbf{r}_{t,i}$ and $\mathbf{\dot{r}}_{t,i}$ presents itself.
Specifically, if one chooses

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{r}_{t,i} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        x_{t,i} & y_{t,i} & \theta_{t,i}
    \end{bmatrix}^T \in \mathcal{R}^3,
\end{equation}
\\
then $\mathbf{\dot{r}}_{t,i} = [\dot{x}_{t,i}, \dot{y}_{t,i}, \dot{\theta}_{t,i}]^T \in \mathcal{R}^3$ and the matrix $\mathbf{E}_{F,i}$ can by comparison be found as

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{E}_{F,i} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        0 & 1 & 0
    \end{bmatrix} \in \mathcal{R}^3.
\end{equation}
\\
The subscript $i$ will now be used as the constraint number, where $n_c$ is the number of constraints/contact points.
The angle of the link at the contact point $\theta_{t,i}$ with respect to the base frame is the same as the angle $\theta$ of the link in contact with respect to the base frame (see Figure \ref{fig:rt-rc}). It can by inspection be seen that $\mathbf{E}_{F,i}$ fulfills the criteria of being of unit size.

%These formulations do not supply an explicit expression of the corresponding constraint hypersurface. It is however not a necessity for the further computations. On the other hand it could be valuable to have the expressions for the hypersurfaces for analysis purposes.

The coordinate space $\mathbf{r}_t$ should be able to aid in expressing all the constraints present on the snake robot. Therefore, it is chosen as 

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{r}_t = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \mathbf{r}_{t,1}^T & \mathbf{r}_{t,2}^T & \dots &\mathbf{r}_{t,n_c}^T
    \end{bmatrix}^T \in \mathcal{R}^{3 n_c}.
\end{equation}
\\
The same goes for $\dot{\mathbf{r}}_t$. Furthermore, the matrix $\mathbf{E}_{F}$ describing the unit normal vectors to all the hypersurfaces can now be written as

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{E}_F = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \mathbf{E}_{F,1} & \mathbf{0}_{1\times3} & \dots & \mathbf{0}_{1\times3} \\
        \mathbf{0}_{1\times3} & \ddots & & \vdots \\
        \vdots & & \ddots & \mathbf{0}_{1\times3} \\
        \mathbf{0}_{1\times3} & \dots & \mathbf{0}_{1\times3} & \mathbf{E}_{F,n_c} \\
    \end{bmatrix} \in \mathcal{R}^{n_c \times 3 n_c}
\end{equation}
\\

Differentiating (\ref{eq:hpfc:derhypsurf}) further gives

\begin{equation}\label{eq:dhpfc_arf}
    \mathbf{E}_F \mathbf{\ddot{r}}_t + \mathbf{a}_{r F} = 0, \quad \mathbf{a}_{r F} = \mathbf{\dot{E}}_F\mathbf{\dot{r}}
\end{equation}
\\
For the snake robot case $\mathbf{a}_{r F} \in \mathcal{R}^{n_c}$.

Furthermore, $\mathbf{E}_P$ is chosen so that all the vectors in the relation

\begin{equation}\label{eq:dhpfc_E}
    \mathbf{E} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
    \mathbf{E}_P \\ \mathbf{E}_F
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
\\
are mutually independent unit vectors. The matrix $\mathbf{E}_F$ represents the coordinate axes normal to the constraint surfaces, and $\mathbf{E}_P$ represents the coordinate axes complementing $\mathbf{E}_F$. Another way to display this is seeing $\mathbf{E}_F$ and $\mathbf{E}_P$ as the axes for force and position constrained directions respectively.

From the equations

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{E\dot{r}} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \mathbf{E}_P \mathbf{\dot{r}}_t\\
        0
    \end{bmatrix}
    \quad \text{and} \quad
    \mathbf{E\ddot{r}}_t =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \mathbf{E}_P \mathbf{\ddot{r}}_t \\
        -\mathbf{a}_{r F}
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
\\
it can be seen that the velocity to the constraint surface is zero, which is natural seeing as the end-effector should be physically unable to move through the surface.

For the snake robot, a simple choice of $\mathbf{E}_{P,i}$ with unit vectors complementing $\mathbf{E}_{F,i}$ is by inspection found to be

\begin{equation}\label{eq:dhpfc_EPi}
    \mathbf{E}_{P,i} = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix} \in \mathcal{R}^{2\times 3}.
\end{equation}
\\
This is a very logical choice, seeing as the snake robot link in contact is allowed to rotate about the obstacle and move along the obstacle.
Again, $\mathbf{E}_{P,i}$ corresponds to the $i$'th constraint. Combining all $\mathbf{E}_{P,i}$ gives 

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{E}_P = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \mathbf{E}_{P,1} & \mathbf{0}_{2\times3} & \dots & \mathbf{0}_{2\times3} \\
        \mathbf{0}_{2\times3} & \ddots & & \vdots \\
        \vdots & & \ddots & \mathbf{0}_{2\times3} \\
        \mathbf{0}_{2\times3} & \dots & \mathbf{0}_{2\times3} & \mathbf{E}_{P,n_c} \\
    \end{bmatrix} \in \mathcal{R}^{2 n_c \times 3 n_c}
\end{equation}
\\
and $\mathbf{E} \in \mathcal{R}^{3 n_c \times 3 n_c}$.

\subsubsection{Kinematics and dynamics}

In \cite{yoshikawa1987dynamic}, the relation between the joint variable vector $\mathbf{q}$ and the end effector position $\mathbf{r}_t$ is expressed as

\begin{equation}\label{eq:hpfc:rq}
    \mathbf{r}_t = \mathbf{c(q)}.
\end{equation}
\\
The following equations are generated by differentiating \ref{eq:hpfc:rq}.

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{\dot{r}}_t = \mathbf{J}_t \mathbf{\dot{q}}, \quad \mathbf{J}_t = \frac{\partial \mathbf{c(q)}}{\partial \mathbf{q}^T}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:dhpfc_aq}
    \mathbf{\ddot{r}}_t = \mathbf{J}_t \mathbf{\ddot{q}} + \mathbf{a}_q, \quad \mathbf{a}_q = \mathbf{\dot{J}}_t \mathbf{\dot{q}}   
\end{equation}
\\
For the snake robot case, the matrix $\mathbf{J}_t$ is the Jacobians of all the contacts.

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{J}_t = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \mathbf{J}_{t,1} \\ \mathbf{J}_{t,2} \\ \vdots \\ \mathbf{J}_{t,n_c}
    \end{bmatrix} \in \mathcal{R}^{3 n_c \times N}
\end{equation}
\\
The Jacobian is also explained in the mentioned section. The Jacobian $\mathbf{J}_{t,i} \in \mathcal{R}^{3\times N}$ for a single contact point with respect to the contact point task variable vector $\mathbf{r}_{t,i}$ is found as 

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{J}_{t,i} =
    \HUGE{
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \frac{\partial x_{t,i}}{\partial q_1} & \dots & \frac{\partial x_{t,i}}{\partial q_N} \\
        \frac{\partial y_{t,i}}{\partial q_1} & \dots & \frac{\partial y_{t,i}}{\partial q_N} \\
        \frac{\partial \theta_{t,i}}{\partial q_1} & \dots & \frac{\partial \theta_{t,i}}{\partial q_N}
    \end{bmatrix}
    }.
\end{equation}
\\
Furthermore, $\mathbf{a}_q \in \mathcal{R}^{n_c}$.

\subsubsection{Calculation of the joint driving force}

The torque resulting from the contact force is found by

\begin{equation}
    \boldsymbol{\tau}_F = \mathbf{J}_t^T \mathbf{E}_F^T \mathbf{f}_F.
\end{equation}
\\
The total torque $\boldsymbol{\tau}$ applied to the robot will be the difference between the motor torque $\boldsymbol{\tau}_c$ and the constraint torque $\boldsymbol{\tau}_F$.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:tau_dhpfc1}
    \boldsymbol{\tau} = \boldsymbol{\tau}_c - \boldsymbol{\tau}_F
\end{equation}
\\

Combining the torque in (\ref{eq:tau_dhpfc1}) with the equations of motion given in (\ref{eq:eom}) gives

\begin{equation}\label{eq:dhpfc_stuff1}
    \mathbf{M(q) \ddot{q}} + \mathbf{J}_t^T \mathbf{E}^T_F \mathbf{f}_F = \boldsymbol{\tau}_c - \mathbf{C(q, \dot{q})}
\end{equation}
\\
and
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dhpfc_stuff2}
    \mathbf{E}_F \mathbf{J}_t\mathbf{\ddot{q}} = - \mathbf{E}_F \mathbf{a}_q - \mathbf{a}_{rF}.
\end{equation}
\\
Lastly, it can be shown that combining (\ref{eq:dhpfc_stuff1}) and (\ref{eq:dhpfc_stuff2}) yields the expressions

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{\ddot{q}} = \mathbf{M}^{-1}(\mathbf{b}_1 + (\mathbf{E}_F \mathbf{J}_t)^T \mathbf{K} (\mathbf{b}_2 - \mathbf{E}_F \mathbf{J}_t \mathbf{M}^{-1} \mathbf{b}_1)),
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{f}_F = -\mathbf{K} (\mathbf{b}_2 - \mathbf{E}_F \mathbf{J}_t \mathbf{M}^{-1} \mathbf{b}_1).
\end{equation}
\\
$\mathbf{K}$, $\mathbf{b}_1$ and $\mathbf{b}_2$ are given by

\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \mathbf{K} &= (\mathbf{E}_F \mathbf{J}_t \mathbf{M}^{-1} \mathbf{J}_t^T \mathbf{E}^T_F)^{-1}\\
        \mathbf{b}_1 &= \boldsymbol{\tau}_c - \mathbf{C(q, \dot{q})}\\
        \mathbf{b}_2 &= - \mathbf{E}_F \mathbf{a}_q - \mathbf{a}_{rF}.
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
\\
Eventually, it is possible to calculate the joint control torque. It consists of a component based on the desired movement $\mathbf{\ddot{r}}_{t,d}$ in the contact point frame and a component based on the desired force $\mathbf{f}_{Fd}$ applied to the constraint surfaces. The direction of the desired force should correspond to which side of the snake robot the obstacle is. This can either be implemented into the higher level controller requesting these forces, or one could introduce a vector $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$ like in \ref{seq:constraints}. This vector consists of positive and negative units corresponding to the different obstacle placements. When multiplied with $\mathbf{f}_{Fd}$ it will simply negate the forces that should be applied to obstacles on the right side of the snake robot.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:dhpfc_tau_c}
    \boldsymbol{\tau}_c = \boldsymbol{\tau}_P + \boldsymbol{\tau}_F
\end{equation}
\\
The torque $\boldsymbol{\tau}_P$ is found by solving the equations of motion given in (\ref{eq:eom}) based on the desired values of the joint accelerations.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:dhpfc_taup}
    \boldsymbol{\tau}_P = \mathbf{M(q)} \ddot{\mathbf{q}}_d + \mathbf{C}(\mathbf{q,\dot{q}})
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:dhpfc_tauf}
    \boldsymbol{\tau}_F = \mathbf{J}_t^T \mathbf{E}^T_F \mathbf{f}_{Fd}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:dhpfc_qddd}
    \ddot{\mathbf{q}}_d = \mathbf{J}_t^+ (\mathbf{E}^{-1} 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \mathbf{\ddot{r}}_{EP,t,d} \\
        - \mathbf{a}_{rF}
    \end{bmatrix}
    - \mathbf{a}_q) + (\mathbf{I}-  \mathbf{J}_t^+ \mathbf{J}_t)\mathbf{k}
\end{equation}
\\
Here the vector $\mathbf{\ddot{r}}_{EP,t,d} = \mathbf{E}_P \mathbf{\ddot{r}}_{t,d}$. Furthermore, $\mathbf{J}_t^+$ denotes the pseudo inverse of the Jacobian.
The last term is included for redundant manipulators, where the vector $\mathbf{k}$ is an arbitrary time function representing the arbitrariness of the joint accelerations. It can be observed that the term $ (\mathbf{I}-  \mathbf{J}_t^+ \mathbf{J}_t)$ is the same as the projection matrix $\prescript{}{j}{\mathbf{P}}_{ap}$ onto the allowable motion space from \ref{subseq:HPFC}.

According to Yoshikawa \cite{yoshikawa1987dynamic} the position and force can be simultaneously controlled by applying the sum of the joint torque $\boldsymbol{\tau}_P$ for achieving the desired acceleration and the joint torque $\boldsymbol{\tau}_F$ for achieving the desired force as long as the robot is not in a singular state.

Describing the desired acceleration through $\mathbf{\ddot{r}}_{t,d}$ might not be the most intuitive task. It is therefore suggested that $\mathbf{E}_P$ is chosen in such a manner that a function $\mathbf{\dot{r}}_{P,t} = s(\mathbf{r}_t)$ exists and satisfies

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{\dot{r}}_{P,t} = \mathbf{E}_P \mathbf{\dot{r}}_t.
\end{equation}
\\
If this holds, then
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{\ddot{r}}_{P,t} = \mathbf{\ddot{r}}_{EP,t} + \mathbf{a}_{rP}, \quad \mathbf{a}_{rP} = \mathbf{\dot{E}}_P \mathbf{\dot{r}}_{P,t}.
\end{equation}
\\
Given that $\mathbf{r}_{P,t}$ is given by $\mathbf{r}_{P,t,d}$ and the described dynamics and constraints are correct, the system given by (\ref{eq:dhpfc_tau_c})-(\ref{eq:dhpfc_qddd}) will be able to realize both the desired position and force.
