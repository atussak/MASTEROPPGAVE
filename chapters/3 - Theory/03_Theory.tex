\chapter{Background theory}\label{chapter:theory}

This chapter gives an overview of some of the most important strategies for terrestrial snake robot locomotion to address the first part of the the thesis project description. The rest of the chapter focuses on theory required to adapt the method of dynamic HPFC to the snake robot model. This includes an explanation of the snake robot kinematics, dynamics and constraints. Lastly, both "traditional" HPFC and dynamic HPFC is explained in detail and discussed with regard to the snake robot application.

Some parts of this chapter are fully or partly taken from the previous project work of the author \cite{AtussaProsjektoppgp}. This is stated in the respective chapters.
