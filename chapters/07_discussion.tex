\section{Dynamic HPFC for snake robots}


\section{Simulation limitations}

Too few links ://

Very bad force sensors..

Twitchy torque controller.

Model is only for specific scenario and all contacts have to remain.

\section{The snake robot position and force space}

\section{Task limitations}

Need many many links and well spaced obstacles.

Minimal CKCs and Jacobians means that the desired contact variables have to be defined with respect to the previous contact point --> not as intuitive as defining everything with respect to the base frame. Could solve by defining wrt base frame and then use homogeneous transformation matrices.
