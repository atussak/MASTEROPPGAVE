\chapter{Simulator}\label{chapter:simulator}

The SnakeSIM simulator \cite{sanfilippo2018snakesim} has been chosen to conduct the experiments considered relevant for this project. This chapter will give an overview of the software and how it is used for this project with the intention of making further contributions and usage easier. The simulator is based in the Robotic Operating System (ROS) \cite{quigley2009ros} and Gazebo \cite{koenig2004design}, and for an in-depth understanding of the code, it is suggested to look at the ROS and Gazebo tutorials online.
