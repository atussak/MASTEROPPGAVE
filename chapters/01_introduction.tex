\section{Scope of the project}

\subsection{Thesis assignment interpretation}

- Introduce some existing locomotion strategies and discuss whether or not they could be combined with dynamic HPFC.
- Mathematically adapt the method of Yoshikawa to the snake robot, paying special attention to the changes that have to be made as a result of the differences between snake robots and traditional robot manipulators.
- Discuss how the dynamic HPFC method could be used to achieve OAL.
- Discuss the limitations of the HOAL problem in the light of which tasks (in force and position space) can actually be realized.
- Discuss what force/position spaces are sufficient for propulsion and which are necessary for propulsion in light of the task realizations(?).
- Design a control structure to test the dynamic HPFC algorithm.
- Find and evaluate a simulator for the testing
- Test the performance of the dynamic HPFC method on snake robots. The tests should shed light on the benefits and limitations of the method.
