\chapter{Experiments}\label{ch:results}

This chapter presents four experiments that aim at visualizing some of the theory presented in Chapter \ref{ch:hpfc}. The experiments cover the mapping onto the essential and allowable position space from \ref{subsec:task-oriented}, the use of various closed kinematic chain formulations from \ref{subsec:task-restrictions}, the computation of control commands only for active joints presented in \ref{subsec:passive-joints}, and lastly the simultaneous control of position and force. All of these experiments are modifications of the dynamic HPFC control presented in \ref{subsec:DHPFC}.

In addition to these control experiments, an experiment for validating the physics of the simulator is initially provided. Furthermore, the simulator setup and related limitations are presented to give a general overview of the experiment framework.
