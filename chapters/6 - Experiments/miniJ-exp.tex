\section{Experiment with various closed kinematic chain formulations}

This experiment aims at showing the differences with the use of the different closed kinematic chain formulations described in \ref{subsec:task-restrictions}.

Control of snake robot with 6 links (5 joints) and three obstacles. Control of the last contact point. The first simulation is with the Jacobian defined from the base frame to the third contact point frame. The second simulation is with the Jacobian defined from the second contact point frame to the third contact point frame.

Look at how qd-dotdot and tauF are affected.
