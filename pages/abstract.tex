%Snake robots are robust serial link robots able to propel themselves through uneven and irregular terrain. As opposed to traditional mobile robots, the snake robot can utilize obstacles found in the environment to push itself forward along a predefined path. The aforementioned mode of locomotion is referred to as \textbf{obstacle aided locomotion (OAL)}. The challenge of both controlling the shape and contact forces of the snake robot has motivated the study of \textbf{hybrid position/force control (HPFC)}, with special emphasis on application within OAL.

Snake robots are serial link robots able to traverse a variety of different terrains. Typical locomotion strategies for flat surfaces include lateral undulation and concertina locomotion. \textbf{Obstacle Aided Locomotion (OAL)} is a method for traversing terrains prone by obstacles like rocks and walls which the snake robot can utilize to push itself forward while following a predetermined path. In order to control the obstacle forces and snake robot shape simultaneously, the \textbf{Hybrid Position/Force Control (HPFC)} method is studied. The combination of OAL and HPFC is referred to as \textbf{Hybrid Obstacle Aided Locomotion (HOAL)}.

In particular, this report is focused on the dynamic HPFC method, which integrates the robot dynamics into the control. The method is thoroughly studied and adapted to the snake robot case. Furthermore, some additions to the method are proposed and tested. It has been found that the simultaneous control of force and position for a snake robot with several contact points is highly dependent on the composition of the snake robot, meaning the number of actuated joints, relative to the number of contact points.

The ROS-based simulator, SnakeSIM, has been used for all experiments presented in this report.

%Due to the complexity of the dynamical model for snake robots with a very large number of links, the experiments were limited to a six-link snake robot. For this reason, the
